Hi,

I thought you might find this SQL query useful.

If you already have access to the data, you can access the query in Data Explorer here https://{{ request.get_host }}{% open_query_in_explorer_link query %}.

You may need to request access to Data Explorer before you can use it: https://data-services-help.trade.gov.uk/data-workspace/how-articles/data-workspace-basics/how-do-i-request-access-tool/.

{{ query }}

Please note this query has been shared with you for internal (DIT) use only.
